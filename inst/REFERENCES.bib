abstract = {Mapping the pathways that give rise to metastasis is one of the key challenges of breast cancer research. Recently, several large-scale studies have shed light on this problem through analysis of gene expression profiles to identify markers correlated with metastasis. Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers not as individual genes but as subnetworks extracted from protein interaction databases. The resulting subnetworks provide novel hypotheses for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis of differential expression, they play a central role in the protein network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual marker genes selected without network information, and that they achieve higher accuracy in the classification of metastatic versus non-metastatic tumors.},

@article{Langfelder2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence that genes and their protein products are organized into functional modules according to cellular processes and pathways. Gene co-expression networks have been used to describe the relationships between gene transcripts. Ample literature exists on how to detect biologically meaningful modules in networks but there is a need for methods that allow one to study the relationships between modules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show that network methods can also be used to describe the relationships between co-expression modules and present the following methodology. First, we describe several methods for detecting modules that are shared by two or more networks (referred to as consensus modules). We represent the gene expression profiles of each module by an eigengene. Second, we propose a method for constructing an eigengene network, where the edges are undirected but maintain information on the sign of the co-expression information. Third, we propose methods for differential eigengene network analysis that allow one to assess the preservation of network properties across different data sets. We illustrate the value of eigengene networks in studying the relationships between consensus modules in human and chimpanzee brains; the relationships between consensus modules in brain, muscle, liver, and adipose mouse tissues; and the relationships between male-female mouse consensus modules and clinical traits. In some applications, we find that module eigengenes can be organized into higher level clusters which we refer to as meta-modules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Eigengene networks can be effective and biologically meaningful tools for studying the relationships between modules of a gene co-expression network. The proposed methods may reveal a higher order organization of the transcriptome.

RCytoscape extends Cytoscape's functionality beyond what is possible with the Cytoscape graphical user interface. To illustrate the power of RCytoscape, a portion of the Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data set from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is examined.

These activities will eventually permit the prediction and control of complex biological systems. Network visualizations--molecular maps--created from an open-ended programming environment rich in statistical power and data-handling facilities, such as RCytoscape, will play an essential role in this progression.},

Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular risk in Caucasian subjects. In this study we examine whether the existing reference values are useable for non-Caucasian ethnicities. Furthermore, we assessed whether gender and smoking affect AGEs., Methods, 
AGEs were determined by a non-invasive method of skin auto-fluorescence (AF). AF was measured in 200 Arabs, 99 South Asians, 35 Filipinos and 14 subjects of other/mixed ethnicity in the Qatar Metabolomics Study on Diabetes (QMDiab). Using multivariate linear regression analysis and adjusting for age and type 2 diabetes, we assessed whether ethnicity, gender and smoking were associated with AF., Results, 
The mean AF was 2.27 arbitrary units (AU) (SD: 0.63). Arabs and Filipinos had a significant higher AF than the South Asian population (0.25 arbitrary units (AU) (95\% CI: 0.11?0.39), p = 0.001 and 0.34 (95\% CI: 0.13?0.55), p = 0.001 respectively). Also, AF was significantly higher in females (0.41 AU (95\% CI: 0.29?0.53), p {\textless} 0.001). AF associated with smoking (0.21 AU (95\% CI: 0.01?0.41), p = 0.04) and increased with the number of pack-years smoked (p = 0.02)., Conclusions, 
This study suggests that the existing reference values should take ethnicity, gender and smoking into account. Larger studies in specific ethnicities are necessary to create ethnic- and gender-specific reference values.},

Evidence from recent clinical trials suggests a beneficial effect of the combination on efficacy, demonstrated by significant improvement of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting and postprandial glucose levels. The fixed dose combination is likely to have greater patient tolerability compared with monotherapy with either agent because of low rates of hypoglycemia, weight neutrality, and lower rates of side effects.

	abstract = {Aims/hypothesis
Metabolomics has opened new avenues for studying metabolic alterations in type 2 diabetes. While many urine and blood metabolites have been associated individually with diabetes, a complete systems view analysis of metabolic dysregulations across multiple biofluids and over varying timescales of glycaemic control is still lacking.

Methods
Here we report a broad metabolomics study in a clinical setting, covering 2,178 metabolite measures in saliva, blood plasma and urine from 188 individuals with diabetes and 181 controls of Arab and Asian descent. Using multivariate linear regression we identified metabolites associated with diabetes and markers of acute, short-term and long-term glycaemic control.

Results
Ninety-four metabolite associations with diabetes were identified at a Bonferroni level of significance (p?{\textless}?2.3?×?10-5), 16 of which have never been reported. Sixty-five of these diabetes-associated metabolites were associated with at least one marker of glycaemic control in the diabetes group. Using Gaussian graphical modelling, we constructed a metabolic network that links diabetes-associated metabolites from three biofluids across three different timescales of glycaemic control.

Conclusions/interpretation
Our study reveals a complex network of biochemical dysregulation involving metabolites from different pathways of diabetes pathology, and provides a reference framework for future diabetes studies with metabolic endpoints.

Associations of metabolism with such outcomes are expected to span functional modules, which are defined as sets of correlating metabolites that are coordinately regulated. Moreover, these associations occur at different scales, from entire pathways to only a few metabolites, which is an aspect that has not been addressed by previous methods. Here we present MoDentify, a freely available R package to identify regulated modules in metabolomics networks at different layers of resolution. Importantly, MoDentify shows higher statistical power than classical association analysis. Moreover, the package offers direct visualization of results as interactive networks in Cytoscape. We present an application example using a complex, multifluid metabolomics dataset. Owing to its generic character, the method is widely applicable to any dataset with a phenotype variable, a data matrix, and optional pathway annotations.
